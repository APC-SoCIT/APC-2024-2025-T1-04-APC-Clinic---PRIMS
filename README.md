**Patient Record and Interaction Management System (PRIMS)**
The Patient Record and Interaction Management System, also known as PRIMS, project at Asia Pacific College’s Clinic is designed to streamline healthcare access for students and faculty. By enabling effortless appointment scheduling with nurses and managing clinic inventory, PRIMS aims to enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of healthcare services on campus. 

       ** Specific Goals**

Locate Medical Records in 2 Minutes: By implementing an electronic health records (EHR) system, the project aims to reduce the time taken to locate a specific medical record to within 2 minutes. This will enhance the clinic's efficiency in handling patient information and providing timely care.

Zero Conflicts in Schedule: The online appointment scheduling system will ensure that there are no conflicts in schedules by providing real-time updates and notifications to both patients and healthcare providers. This system will help avoid double-booking and ensure smooth appointment management.

Generate Monthly Summary Reports in About 2 Minutes: The automated reporting tools will compile data from the clinic's operations and generate comprehensive monthly summary reports in approximately 2 minutes. This will significantly reduce the time and effort required for manual report generation, allowing staff to focus more on patient care.

        **In pursuit of this goal, the project team aims to:**

Develop a User-Friendly Interface.
Implement an Online Appointment Scheduling System.
Design a Comprehensive Patient Information Database.
Integrate Medication Inventory Tracking.
Ensure Data Security and Privacy.
